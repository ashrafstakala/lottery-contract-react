# React app for Ethereum Lottery smart contract

- React Web App that allows Metamask users to enter the smart contract lottery. Mininum of 0.11 ETH required to enter.
- Although any user can click on Pick winner, a winner will only be selected if the person who deployed the smart contract picks the winner.
- After a winner has been picked, the lottery total balance will be sent to their Metamask wallet and the lottery will reset.

NB: This is running on the Rinkeby test network, using test eth, loaded in test Metamask wallets. No real ETH, wallets or seed phrases are used in this project.
